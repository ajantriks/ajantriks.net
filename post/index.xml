&lt;h4 id=&#34;co-authored-with-adya-garg-published-by-the-wire-http-thewire-in-2016-05-16-before-geospatial-bill-a-long-history-of-killing-the-map-in-order-to-protect-the-territory-36453:26906d7510c4a6c3ffdbbbee2ba326c2&#34;&gt;Co-authored with Adya Garg. Published by &lt;a href=&#34;http://thewire.in/2016/05/16/before-geospatial-bill-a-long-history-of-killing-the-map-in-order-to-protect-the-territory-36453/&#34;&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global history of cartography is intimately linked with political needs and economic interests, from the public depiction of sovereign territories to navigating treacherous seas to (wrongly) ‘discover’ the land of spices. In India, the politics of making and using maps has taken a sudden and complex turn with the publication of the draft Geospatial Information Regulation Bill, 2016. Contrary to the expectations arising out of several government schemes that are promoting the development of the new digital economy in India – from start-ups to the ongoing expansion of connectivity network – the bill seems to be undoing various economic and humanitarian efforts, and other opportunities involving maps, by imposing strict guidelines and harsh penalties on the use of maps by private actors, commercial or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/GeospatialBill_05052016_eve.pdf&#34;&gt;introductory note to the bill&lt;/a&gt; clearly states its primary objective is to ensure the protection of ‘security, sovereignty and integrity of India.’ The concern around ‘security’ is not new when it comes to regulating cartographic activities. It is prominently addressed across the current set of policies and guidelines that govern mapping in India: 1) the National Map Policy, 2005 (“NMP”) and associated guidelines issued by the Survey of India, 2) the Remote Sensing Data Policy, 2011 that regulates satellite-based mapping, and 3) the Civil Aviation Requirement, 2012, which regulates mapping and photography using flights and drones. Protection of ‘sovereignty and integrity,’ however, does not find a mention in any of these map-related policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have of course been several incidents where the government has taken steps (including the temporary blocking of service) against companies that have represented Indian national boundaries that are not in accordance with official maps. Such companies include &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;. Two companies that have gotten away with no consequences after publicly showing maps of India without certain border regions, interestingly, are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scoopwhoop.com/news/kashmir-missing-from-india-map/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://thewire.in/2015/05/14/chinese-state-owned-television-shows-india-map-sans-jammu-kashmir-arunachal-1698/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;CCTV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of such provisions in the existing map-related policies, thus far, the government has pursued legal action against such ‘anti-national’ depiction of  Indian territory under  Section 69A of the IT Act, 2000, the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (restricting the collection and sharing of information about ‘prohibited places’), the Customs Act, 1962 (prohibiting the export and import of certain maps), and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act,1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this present bill has come into public attention rather suddenly, the Indian State has been planning for a comprehensive legal framework for both enabling and restricting mapping, since the coming of the NMP itself. The first avatar of this effort was the Indian Survey Act that was heard about in 2007, but  was never made public. More recently, the first report towards the National Geospatial Information Policy (now called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dst.gov.in/sites/default/files/Draft-NGP-Ver%201%20ammended_05May2016.pdf&#34;&gt;National Geospatial Policy&lt;/a&gt;) came out in 2012. Instead of waiting for this comprehensive policy to be discussed and notified, the bill seems to have come in a hurry to propose a narrowly designed legal instrument. As is often the problem with such precise devices that also want to be exhaustive, the bill promises much more collateral damage than actual solutions – it ends up killing the map in the name of protecting the territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look at case law on map-related disputes informs us about the motivations of the state in enacting this bill. A major controversy around ‘sovereignty’ in the field of mapping has been about the depiction of international boundaries of India by Google. After several incidents of conflicts between Google’s map makers and the Indian State regarding the depiction of India’s national boundary, the Survey of India filed a police complaint in 2014. As a result, Google presently shows different map tiles to users from India (according to the boundary specified by the Indian State) and different tiles to users from elsewhere. This geo-targeted solution to the depiction of international borders under dispute has been practiced by Google in the case of other countries too, most notably for &lt;a href=&#34;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/the-first-google-maps-war/&#34;&gt;Nicaragua, Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://jtl.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/03/Merel_54-CJTL-425.pdf&#34;&gt;Ukraine and (independent) Crimea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internal security concerns have also fuelled conflicts with mapping companies. In 2013, the ‘mapathon’ organised by Google faced a lawsuit for not asking for prior permission from the Survey of India for this exercise in user-contributed mapping. This was preceded by a petition filed by J. Mohanraj in the Madras High Court seeking a complete ban on the Google Earth and Bhuvan (run by ISRO) map applications on the ground that they were both  providing information that could be used for planning acts of terror. The petitioner’s argument referred to the provisions of the NMP, and also alleged that such mapping practices violated the individual rights of a person under Article 21 of the Constitution. The court, however, held (2008) that the petitioner was unable to produce any specific “Guidelines/Rules/Law laid down by the Central/State Governments, prohibiting the private organisations or any other individuals to Interactive Mapping Program, covering vast majority of the Planet”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble with Google re-opened earlier this year as the Pathankot air base was attacked. Incidentally, Vishal Saini, the winner of the 2013 mapathon by Google, contributed to mapping the features of the very same city. Promptly after the attack in January, Lokesh Kumar Sharma filed a case in the Delhi High Court alleging that the availability of sensitive information (from an internal security point-of-view) on Google Maps created security vulnerabilities. In a rather curious manner, the court disposed of the case on February 24, claiming that it has learned from the Additional Solicitor General that ‘steps are in progress to regulate the publication of aerial/satellite geospatial data.’ In hindsight, we see that this was in reference to the draft bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bill, evidently, is a product of the Indian State’s inefficient attempts at regulating the making and circulation of maps and geospatial data in digital times. The bill ends up disregarding the actual features of digital geospatial data and how it forms a fundamental basis (and asset) for today’s digital economy, and, instead, decides to settle for a form of regulation that is much better suited (if at all) to a pre-digital and pre-liberalisation condition. The regulatory measures proposed by the bill do not only cause worry but also bewilderment. Take for example Section 3 that states that ‘no person shall acquire geospatial imagery or data including value addition of any part of India’ without being expressly given permission for the same or being vetted by the nodal agency set up by the Bill. If implemented strictly, this may mean that you will have to ask for permission and/or security vetting before dropping a pin on the map and sharing your coordinates with your friend or a taxi service. Both involve creating/acquiring geospatial information, and potentially adding value to the map/taxi service as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an even more bizarre hypothetical situation – the Security Vetting Agency being asked to go through the entire geospatial data chest of Google everyday (or as soon as it is updated) and it taking up to ‘ three months from the date of receipt’ of the data to complete this checking so that Google Maps can tell you how crowded a particular street was three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, a key term that the bill does not talk about is ‘big data.’ The static or much-slowly-changing geospatial data such as national boundaries and which-military-institute-is-located-where are really the tiny minority of the global geospatial information. The much larger and crucial part is of course the fast-moving big geospatial data – from geo-referenced tweets, to GPS systems of cars, to mobile phones moving through the cities and regions. Addressing such networked data systems, where all data can quite easily be born-georeferenced, and the security and privacy concerns that are engendered by them, should be the ultimate purpose of, and challenge for, a future-looking Geospatial Information Regulation Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present bill imposes an undesirable bureaucratic structure of licenses and permits upon the GIS industry in the country in particular, and on all sections of the economy using networked devices in general. This will only end up restricting the size of the GIS industry to a few dominant players. For all creators and users of maps for non-commercial, developmental, and humanitarian interests, this bill appears to be an imminent threat, even if it is never actually applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a book section written for the &lt;em&gt;Asia Internet History - Third Decade (2001~2010)&lt;/em&gt; volume edited by Prof. Kilnam Chon. The book was published, both in print and as an online open access version, in December 2015. Read the book online here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/internethistoryasia/book3&#34;&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/internethistoryasia/book3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-days:6f3e254fa7e36617681563e9a0a54cad&#34;&gt;Early Days&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching context of development interventions and rights-based approaches has shaped the space of civil society organizations working on the topics of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and Internet governance in India. Early members of this space came from diverse backgrounds. Satish Babu was working with the South Indian Federation of Fishermen Societies (SIFFS) in the mid-1990s, when he set up a public mailing list called &amp;lsquo;FishNet,&amp;rsquo; connected to the Internet via the IndiaLink email network, (then) run by India Social Institute to inter-connect development practitioners in India. He went on to become the President of Computer Society of India during 2012-2013; he also co-founded the Society for Promotion of Alternative Computing and Employment (SPACE) in 2003, where he served as the Executive Secretary during 2003-2010 &lt;code&gt;[Wikipedia 2015]&lt;/code&gt;. Anita Gurumurthy, Executive Director of IT for Change and one of the key actors from Indian civil society organizations that took part in the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) process, had previously worked extensively on topics related to public health and women&amp;rsquo;s rights &lt;code&gt;[ITfC 2015b]&lt;/code&gt;, which deeply shaped the perspectives she and IT for Change have brought into the Internet governance sphere, globally as well as nationally &lt;code&gt;[Gurumurthy 2001]&lt;/code&gt;. Arun Mehta initiated a mailing list titled &amp;lsquo;India-GII&amp;rsquo; in 2002 to discuss &amp;lsquo;India&amp;rsquo;s bumpy progress on the global infohighway&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;[India-GII 2005]&lt;/code&gt;. This list played a critical role in curating an early community of non-governmental actors interested in the topics of telecommunication policy, spectrum licensing, Internet governance, and consumer and communication rights. As Frederick Noronha documented, the mailing list culture grew slowly in India during the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, they had a great impact on organizing early online communities, sometimes grouped around a topical focus, sometimes functioning as a bridge among family members living abroad, and sometimes curating place-specific groups &lt;code&gt;[Noronha 2002]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inaugural conference of the Free Software Foundation of India (FSFI) in Thiruvananthapuram, on 20 July 2001, galvanized the Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) community in India. The conference was titled &amp;lsquo;Freedom First,&amp;rsquo; and Richard Stallman was invited as the chief guest. It was a vital gathering of actors from civil society organizations, software businesses, academia, and media, as well as the Secretary of the Department of Information Technology, Government of Kerala (the state where the conference was held). The conference laid the basis for sustained collaborations between the free software community, civil society organizations, emerging software firms in the state, and the Government of Kerala for the years to come. Two early initiatives that brought together free software developers and state government agencies were the Kerala Transportation Project and the IT@School project, which not only were awarded to firms promoting use of FLOSS in electronic governance projects, but also facilitated a wider public dialogue regarding the need to think critically about the making of an information society in India &lt;code&gt;[Kumar 2007]&lt;/code&gt;. The inter-connected communities and overlapping practices of the FLOSS groups, civil society organizations involved in ICT for Development initiatives, telecommunication policy analysts and advocates, and legal-administrative concerns regarding life in the information society – from digital security and privacy, to freedom of online expressions, to transparency in electronic governance infrastructures – have, hence, continued to shape the sub-spherer of civil society organizations in India that are discussing, responding to, and contributing to policies and practices around the Internet governance in India and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-organizations:6f3e254fa7e36617681563e9a0a54cad&#34;&gt;Key Organizations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT for Change was established in 2000, in Bengaluru, as a non-governmental organization that &amp;lsquo;works for the innovative and effective use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to promote socio-economic change in the global south, from an equity, social justice and gender equality point of view&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;[ITfC 2015]&lt;/code&gt;. It has since made important contributions in the field of ICTs for Development, especially in integrating earlier communication rights practices organized around old media forms with newer possibilities of production and distribution of electronic content using digital media and the Internet &lt;code&gt;[ITfC 2015e]&lt;/code&gt;, and in the field of the Internet governance, especially through their participation in the WSIS and Internet Governance Forum (IGF) processes and by co-shaping the Internet governance discourse in and from the global south &lt;code&gt;[ITfC 2015d]&lt;/code&gt;. It has also done significant works in the area of women&amp;rsquo;s rights in the information society, and has been a core partner in a multi-country feminist action research project on using digital media to enhance the citizenship rights and experiences of marginalized women in India, Brazil, and South Africa &lt;code&gt;[ITfC 2015c]&lt;/code&gt;. IT for Change co-led the formation of Just Net Coalition in February 2014 &lt;code&gt;[JNC 2015]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF) was founded by Osama Manzar in New Delhi in 2002, with a &amp;lsquo;deep understanding that marginalized communities living in socio-economic backwardness and information poverty can be empowered to improve their lives almost on their own, simply by providing them access to information and knowledge using digital tools&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;[DEF 2015c]&lt;/code&gt;. DEF has contributed to setting up Community Information Resource Centres from 19 states and 53 districts in India, with computers, printers, scanners, and Internet connectivity &lt;code&gt;[DEF 2015]&lt;/code&gt;. DEF organizes one of the biggest competitions in Asia to identify, foreground and honor significant contributions in the area of ICT for Development &lt;code&gt;[DEF 2015d]&lt;/code&gt;. This annual competition series, titled the &amp;lsquo;Manthan Award&amp;rsquo; (&amp;lsquo;manthan&amp;rsquo; means &amp;lsquo;churning&amp;rsquo; in Sanskrit), started in 2004. It has allowed DEF to create a detailed database of ICT for Development activities and actors in the South Asia and Asia Pacific region. Since 2011, DEF has been working with Association for Progressive Communications on a project titled &amp;lsquo;Internet Rights&amp;rsquo; to move forward the agenda of &amp;lsquo;Internet access for all&amp;rsquo; in India &lt;code&gt;[DEF 2015b]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Society for Knowledge Commons was formed in New Delhi 2007 by &amp;lsquo;scientists, technologists, researchers, and activists to leverage the tremendous potential of the “collaborative innovation” model for knowledge generation that has lead to the growth of the Free and Open Source Software community (FOSS) around the world&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;[SKC 2015]&lt;/code&gt;. It has championed integration of FOSS into public sector operations in India – from electronic governance systems to the use of software in educational institutes – and has continuously intervened in Internet governance issues from the perspective of the critical importance of shared knowledge properties and practices for a more democratic information society. It is a part of the Free Software Movement of India &lt;code&gt;[FSMI 2015]&lt;/code&gt;, an alliance of Indian organizations involved in advocating awareness and usage of FOSS, as well as a founding member of the Just Net Coalition &lt;code&gt;[JNC 2015]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centre for Internet and Society (CIS) was established in Bengaluru in 2008 with a research and advocacy focus on topics of accessibility of digital content for differently-abled persons, FOSS and policies on intellectual property rights, open knowledge and Indic language Wikipedia projects, digital security and privacy, freedom of expression and Internet governance, and socio-cultural and historical studies of Internet in India &lt;code&gt;[CIS 2015]&lt;/code&gt;. In one of the key early projects, CIS contributed to the creation of web accessibility policy for government websites in India, which was being drafted by the Department of Information Technology, Government of India &lt;code&gt;[CIS 2008]&lt;/code&gt;. In the following years it took part in Internet Governance Forum summits; submitted responses and suggestions to various policies being introduced by the government, especially the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008, National Identification Authority of India (NIA) Bill, 2010, and the Approach Paper for Legislation on Privacy, 2010; produced a report on the state of open government data in India &lt;code&gt;[Prakash 2011b]&lt;/code&gt;; and undertook an extensive study on the experiences of young people in Asia with Internet, digital media, and social change &lt;code&gt;[Shah 2011]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Software Freedom Law Centre has undertaken research and advocacy interventions, since 2011, on the topics of digital privacy, software patents, and cyber-surveillance &lt;code&gt;[SFLC 2015]&lt;/code&gt;. The Internet Democracy Project, an initiative of Point of View, has organized online and offline discussions, participated in global summits, and produced reports on the topics of freedom of expression, cyber security and human rights, and global Internet governance architecture since 2012 &lt;code&gt;[IDP 2015]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Internet Society chapter to be established in India was in Delhi. The chapter began in 2002 but went through a period of no activity before being revived in 2008 &lt;code&gt;[Delhi 2015]&lt;/code&gt;. The Chennai chapter started in 2007 &lt;code&gt;[Chennai 2015]&lt;/code&gt;, the Kolkata one in 2009 &lt;code&gt;[Kolkata 2015]&lt;/code&gt;, and the Bengaluru chapter came into existence in 2010 &lt;code&gt;[Bangalore 2015]&lt;/code&gt;. Asia Internet Symposium have been organized in India twice: 1) the Kolkata one, held on on 1 December 2014, focused on &amp;lsquo;Internet and Human Rights: Empowering the Users,&amp;rsquo; and 2) the Chennai symposium, held on 2 December 2014, discussed &amp;lsquo;India in the Open and Global Internet.&amp;rsquo; The newest Internet Society chapter in India is in the process of formation in Trivandrum &lt;code&gt;[Trivandrum 2015]&lt;/code&gt;, led by the efforts of Satish Babu (mentioned above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;global-and-national-events:6f3e254fa7e36617681563e9a0a54cad&#34;&gt;Global and National Events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) conference held on 10-12 December 2003 in Geneva, was not attended by many civil society organizations from India. Several Indian participants in the conference were part of a team of representatives from different global civil society organizations, including Digital Partners, Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN), and International Centre for New Media &lt;code&gt;[ITU 2003]&lt;/code&gt;. Between the first and the second conference, engagement with the WSIS process increased among Indian civil society organizations, and was especially led by IT for Change. In early 2005, before the second Preparatory Committee meeting for the Tunis conference, IT for Change organized a discussion event titled &amp;lsquo;Gender Perspectives on the Information Society: South Asia Pre-WSIS Seminar&amp;rsquo; in partnership with DAWN and the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, which was supported by UNIFEM and the UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme &lt;code&gt;[Gurumurthy 2006]&lt;/code&gt;. In a separate note, Anita Gurumurthy and Parminder Jeet Singh of IT for Change noted their experience as a South Asian civil society organization engaging with the WSIS process &lt;code&gt;[Gurumurthy 2005]&lt;/code&gt;. The second WSIS conference in Tunis, held on 16-18 November 2005, however, did not see significant participation from Indian civil society organizations, except for Ambedkar Centre for Justice and Peace, Childline India Foundation / Child Helpline International, and IT for Change &lt;code&gt;[ITU 2005]&lt;/code&gt;. This contrasted sharply with the over 60 delegates from various Indian government agencies that took part in the conference &lt;code&gt;[ITU 2005]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two important events took place in India in early 2005 that substantially contributed to the civil society discourses in India around information technology and its socio-legal implications and possibilities. The firt was a conference titled &amp;lsquo;Contested Commons, Trespassing Publics&amp;rsquo; organized by the Sarai Programme at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Alternative Law Forum, and Public Service Broadcasting Trust, in Delhi on 6-8 January 2005. This conference attempted to look into the terms of intellectual property rights (IPR) debates from the perspectives of experiences in countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. It was based on research carried out by the Sarai Programme and Alternative Law Forum on contemporary realities of media production and distribution, and the ways in which law and legal instruments enter into the most intimate spheres of social and cultural life to operationalize IPRs. The conference combined academic discussions with parallel demonstrations by media practitioners, and knowledge sharing by FLOSS communities &lt;code&gt;[Sarai 2005]&lt;/code&gt;. The second event was the first Asia Source workshop, which took place in Bengaluru during 28 January - 4 February 2005. It brought together more than 100 representatives from South and South-East Asian civil society organizations and technology practitioners working with them, along with several leading practitioners from Africa, Europe, North America, and Latin America, to promote adoption and usage of FLOSS across the developmental sector in the region. The workshop was organized by Mahiti (Bengaluru) and Tactical Technology Collective (Amsterdam), with intellectual and practical support from an advisory group of representatives from FLOSS communities and civil society organizations, and financial support from Hivos, the Open Society Institute, and International Open Source Network &lt;code&gt;[Asia 2015]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the participation of representatives from Indian civil society organizations at the IGFs in Athens (2006) and Rio de Janeiro (2007) was minimal, the IGF Hyderabad, held on 3-6 December 2008, provided a great opportunity for Indian civil society actors to participate in and familiarize themselves with the global Internet governance process. Apart from various professionals, especially lawyers, who attended the Hyderabad conference as individuals, the leading civil society organizations participating in the event included: Ambedkar Center for Justice and Peace, Centre for Internet and Society, Centre for Science, Development and Media Studies, Digital Empowerment Foundation, Internet Society Chennai chapter, IT for Change, and Mahiti. The non-governmental participants from India at the event, however, were predominantly from private companies and academic institutes &lt;code&gt;[IGF 2008]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT for Change made a critical intervention into the discourse of global Internet governance during the Hyderabad conference by bringing back the term &amp;lsquo;enhanced cooperation&amp;rsquo;, as mentioned in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society &lt;code&gt;[ITU 2005b]&lt;/code&gt;. At IGF Sharm El Sheikh, held during 15-18 November 2009, Parminder Jeet Singh of IT for Change explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[E]nhanced cooperation consists of two parts. One part is dedicated to creating globally applicable policy principles, and there is an injunction to the relevant organizations to create the conditions for doing that. And I have a feeling that the two parts of that process have been conflated into one. And getting reports from the relevant organizations is going on, but we are not able to go forward to create a process which addresses the primary purpose of enhanced cooperation, which was to create globally applicable public policy principles and the proof of that is that I don&amp;rsquo;t see any development of globally applicable public policy principles, which remains a very important need &lt;code&gt;[IGF 2009]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This foregrounding of the principle of &amp;lsquo;enhanced cooperation&amp;rsquo; has since substantially contributed to rethinking of not only the global Internet governance mechanisms and its reconfigurations, but also the Indian government&amp;rsquo;s perspectives towards the same. It eventually led to the proposal made by a representative of Government of India at the UN General Assembly session on 26 October 2011 regarding the establishment of a UN Committee for Internet-Related Policies &lt;code&gt;[Singh 2011]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;internet-policies-and-censorship:6f3e254fa7e36617681563e9a0a54cad&#34;&gt;Internet Policies and Censorship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest instances of censorship of online content in India was the blocking of several websites offering Voice over IP (VoIP) software, which can be downloaded to make low-cost international calls, during the late 1990s. The India-GII mailing list initiated by Arun Mehta, as mentioned above, started largely as a response to this blocking move by Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), the government-owned Internet Service Provider (ISP). Additionally, Mehta filed a case against VSNL for blocking these e-commerce websites, which might be identified as the first case of legal activism for Internet-related rights in India &lt;code&gt;[India-GII 2001]&lt;/code&gt;. During the war between India and Pakistan in 1999, the Indian government instructed VSNL to block various Pakistani media websites, including that of Dawn. As in the case of websites offering VoIP services, this blocking did not involve direct intervention with the websites concerned but only the ability of Indian users to access them &lt;code&gt;[Tanna 2004]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first well-known case of the Government of India blocking digital content for political reasons occurred in 2003 when a mailing list titled &amp;lsquo;Kynhun&amp;rsquo; was banned. The Department of Telecommunications instructed all the ISPs to stop Indian users from accessing the list, hosted don Yahoo! Group, but the previously deployed URL-blocking strategy did not work in this new situation. Blocking the URL of the list did not stop its members from continuing to share emails through it. The Government of India then approached Yahoo! directly to ensure that the mailing list was taken down, which Yahoo! declined to implement. This resulted in the imposition of a blanket block on all Yahoo! Groups pages across ISPs in India in September 2003. By November, Yahoo! decided to close down the mailing list, and the blanket block was repealed &lt;code&gt;[Tanna 2004]&lt;/code&gt;. Further blocking of several blogs and websites continued through 2006 and 2007, where the government decided to work in collaboration with various platforms offering hosted blog and personal web page services to remove access to specific sub-domains. In resistance to this series of blocking orders by the government, there emerged an important civil society campaign titled &amp;lsquo;Bloggers Against Censorship&amp;rsquo; led by the Bloggers Collective Group, a distributed network of bloggers from all across India &lt;code&gt;[Bloggers 2006]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks after the IGF Hyderabad, the Government of India passed the Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008 on 22 December 2008 &lt;code&gt;[MoLaJ 2009]&lt;/code&gt;, although it was notified and enforced much later on 27 October 2009 &lt;code&gt;[MoCaIT 2009]&lt;/code&gt;. This amendment attempted to clarify various topics left under-defined in the Information Technology Act of 2000. However, as Pranesh Prakash of the Centre for Internet and Society noted, the casual usage of the term &amp;lsquo;offensive content&amp;rsquo; in the amendment opened up serious threats of broad curbing of freedom of online expression under the justification that it caused &amp;lsquo;annoyance&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;inconvenience&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;[Prakash 2009]&lt;/code&gt;. Sections 66 and 67 of the amended Information Technology Act, which respectively address limits to online freedom of expression and legally acceptable monitoring of digital communication by government agencies, have since been the objects of strong protests by civil society organizations across India for enabling broad-brushed censorship and surveillance of the Internet in India. Section 66A has, in particular, allowed the government to make a series of arrests of Internet users for posting and sharing &amp;lsquo;offensive content&amp;rsquo; &lt;code&gt;[Pahwa 2015]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the Government of India introduced another critical piece of policy instrument for controlling online expressions – the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, 2011 &lt;code&gt;[MoCaIT 2011]&lt;/code&gt; – targeted at defining the functions of the intermediaries associated with Internet-related services and communication, and how they are to respond to the government&amp;rsquo;s directives towards taking down and temporarily blocking digital content. The draft rules were published in early 2011 and comments were invited from the general public. One of the responses, submitted by Privacy India and the Centre for Internet and Society, explicitly highlighted the draconian implications of the (then) proposed rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rule requires an intermediary to take immediately steps to remove access to information merely upon receiving a written request from “any authority mandated under the law”. Thus, for example, any authority can easily immunize itself from criticism on the internet by simply sending a written notice to the intermediary concerned. This is directly contrary to, and completely subverts the legislative intent expressed in Section 69B which lays down an elaborate procedure to be followed before any information can be lawfully blocked &lt;code&gt;[Prakash 2011]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy apparatus of controlling online expression in India took full form by the beginning of the decade under study here. The &amp;lsquo;chilling effect&amp;rsquo; of this apparatus was made insightfully evident by a study conducted by Rishabh Dara at the Centre for Internet and Society, where fake takedown notices (regarding existing digital content) were sent to seven important Internet intermediaries operating in India, and their responses were studied. The results of this experiment demonstrated that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[T]he Rules create uncertainty in the criteria and procedure for administering the takedown, thereby inducing the intermediaries to err on the side of caution and over-comply with takedown notices in order to limit their liability, and as a result suppress legitimate expressions. Additionally, the Rules do not establish sufficient safeguards to prevent misuse and abuse of the takedown process to suppress legitimate expressions &lt;code&gt;[Dara 2012]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explore here public and private initiatives in technological solutions for educating the poor and the disadvantaged in India since the second half of the twentieth century. Specifically, we document Ministry of Human Resource Development’s project to develop an affordable tablet computer, named ‘Aakash,’ as a personal access device for digital courses and online learning materials. We approach this case study in relation to several educational technologies that preceded it, and with a wider interest in mapping a contemporary transition from satellite-based mass education to Internet-based mass education. We argue that this process cannot be easily seen as a transition from unilateral broadcasting to more democratic multi-casting model of communication and learning. Specifically, we study the manufacturing process of Aakash and the public debates around it, to comment on the nature of state power in India, as revealed in its attempts to imagine and develop a digital personal device to deliver mass education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) of the Government of India launched a set of prototype devices of an affordable tablet computer, the development and production of which were to be supported by the Ministry as part of its larger ICTs for education project. This device later came to be known as the “Aakash” tablet, and the project went through several iterations, between 2010 and 2014, of not only technological re-designs, but also institutional arrangements to design, develop, manufacture, test, and procure the devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;technological-solutions-for-mass-education:fa4f0317257e65139c9248e2974ab462&#34;&gt;Technological Solutions for Mass Education&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our exploration of technological solutions for mass education in India has taken us through a not-so-linear history of projects that have informed the imagination and making of the Aakash project. This include the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment, or SITE (1975); University Grants Commission-led Countrywide Classroom project (1984 -); the Simputer, the first hand-held device developed in India (1998); the Hole in the Wall project developed and led by Sugata Mitra (1999); the Government of India-led EDUSAT (2004); National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (2003); and finally, a national online education portal named Sakshat (2006). The Satellite Instructional Television Experiment itself terminated rather quickly, but it led to several versions of television based instruction programmes, most notably aimed at higher secondary and university students. Instruction in the broadcast-format continues to date, even after the arrival of the internet and the fact it has become the preferred medium for the Indian state. The television has not been replaced, but certainly shadowed by a variety of internet access and computing devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;aakash-a-low-cost-access-cum-computing-device:fa4f0317257e65139c9248e2974ab462&#34;&gt;Aakash, a “Low Cost Access-Cum-Computing Device”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early official description of the then-nameless tablet as a “low cost access-cum-computing device” is noteworthy &lt;code&gt;[1]&lt;/code&gt;. It is difficult to imagine a contemporary computing device that does not also function as an access device (say, to the internet). Where does the need for calling it an “access-cum-computing” device come from? It comes, perhaps, from the hierarchy of priority – the device is primarily an access device, and secondarily can perform the function of a general-purpose computer. An archaeological reading of the assumptions of learning processes embodied in this device reveals an earlier layer of thinking – that of broadcasting educational programmes to television sets via satellite connection. Labelling it as “access-cum-computing” frames the object as being shaped by the residue of the Indian state’s education technological experiences of the past, including that of the SITE initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-aakash-tablet-was-my-dream-but-it-was-not-fulfilled:fa4f0317257e65139c9248e2974ab462&#34;&gt;“[The] Aakash tablet was my dream but it was not fulfilled”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the short history of the Aakash device, the verdict of “failed innovation” figures prominently – from the early failure of “Sakshat” &lt;code&gt;[2]&lt;/code&gt;, to allegations of the Chinese origin of the Aakash device &lt;code&gt;[3]&lt;/code&gt;, to manufacturing troubles and under-production of the device &lt;code&gt;[4]&lt;/code&gt;, to criticisms of the tablet’s built quality and computing capacity &lt;code&gt;[5]&lt;/code&gt;, to mistrust and failed collaborations between parties involved in its production &lt;code&gt;[6]&lt;/code&gt;, and intra-governmental criticisms of the implementation process &lt;code&gt;[7]&lt;/code&gt;. Moreover, there remained a continuous tension within the government itself regarding the necessity of the project, especially fuelled by (and fuelling) the image of the project as being driven by the dreams of a specific minister &lt;code&gt;[8]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simply describe the Aakash project’s failure as one due to the unbearable heaviness of functions ranging from the technical to the symbolic and political is to fall short of a full explanation. Alongside that narrative of failure, it is critical to foreground the quiet success of the project in establishing the tablet computer as a near-essential and familiarised everyday object for access to educational material. There is an alarming accuracy in the MHRD claim that the Aakash project established a sub $100 tablet market in India – it did, even if it was not for the device they wanted to promote &lt;code&gt;[9]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-device-is-the-desire:fa4f0317257e65139c9248e2974ab462&#34;&gt;The Device is the Desire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observe that the Aakash project, as well as the ones preceding it, have been driven primarily by a desire to scale up the provision of education. The initiatives towards building delivery infrastructures for such mass-scale provision of education has almost always been accompanied by a larger desire for developing capabilities in space exploration, communication, and computing – the key technologies of twentieth century geopolitics. Our study of the manufacturing of the Aakash tablet, and its surrounding discourses, foreground the technological imagination of the state after liberalisation in India (1991), and its unique arrangements and efforts to create domestic capability of technological innovation in a context of globalised production and communication networks. We see our role as one of recovering the work of technology in the history of education as understood through the interactions between the state, academia, and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;archival-research-in-increasingly-digital-india:fa4f0317257e65139c9248e2974ab462&#34;&gt;Archival Research in (Increasingly) Digital India&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documenting the project has been an interesting historical exercise. We have been attentive to documents disappearing from their online locations. One remarkable possibility for archival research opened up by the internet is the (limited, and often uncertain) ability to access materials that are not presently available on a website, but were part of it in the past. This possibility allowed us to access a few crucial government documents that are not directly available on the official websites any more. We have also been attentive to the reiterations and revisions that do not merely overtake or shadow earlier documents. They sometimes erase earlier documents altogether as digital revisions. We do not have access to personal correspondence or internal institutional correspondence relating to the project. We are, however, skeptical of that happening as no protocols for the archiving of digital correspondence is yet in place with the Government of India. Doing recent history of India is becoming an ever more difficult exercise that historians must urgently attend to, if we are to make the present ready to have its own past in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/Watch-Dogs.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Codes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubisoft.com/de-DE/game/watch-dogs/&#34;&gt;Watch Dogs&lt;/a&gt;, by Ubisoft, has finally come out. In this game, you play an urban hacker in Chicago, who can hack into the operating system of the city and turn the very built environment into a weapon. We have talked about the game &lt;a href=&#34;http://popupcity.net/data-driven-urban-citizenship/&#34;&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; in the context of how data-driven urban infrastructures create new possibilities of looking at the city and acting in it — for governments, citizens and hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the advertisement campaign for the game, Devin Graham has directed a short action sequence that brings together parkour running and urban hacking. This amazing clip shows how we inhabit the city both physically and informationally — and can hack it by going beyond the designed circuits of physical movement, and access to information and data-driven control systems. 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/UIkkiyGKfA0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such concerns about the collapsing of physical and or informational dimensions of the city is not something that begins with the integration of computers into urban infrastructure. One of the greatest explorations of this topic can be found in Gillo Pontecorvo’s ‘&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Algiers&#34;&gt;The Battle of Algiers&lt;/a&gt;.’ The film narrates the incidents of urban guerilla warfare in Algiers during the Algerian War of 1954-62. Throughout the film, the physicality and the knowledge about the urban spaces of Algiers — divided into the ‘modern’ French town and the ‘native’ city of casbah — is the very object and site of struggle for control of the city. Throughout the film, it is crucial for the French police and military to dominate urban mobility by gaining information about identities, intentions and locations of the Algerians. Converesely, the Algerian guerilla hides their existence not only through physical means (dresses and wells) but also through their knowledge of the alleys of casbah. Interestingly, one of the most iconic sequence of the film is of a boy hijacking a microphone system at a city checkpost and using it to announce pro-Algeria messages. 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/ToFw7zqJ_sc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Brewster raises the obvious question of whether increasing integration of software and software-controlled hardware into the body of cities is making it more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/21/smart-cities-future-stupid-hack-terrorism-watchdogs&#34;&gt;vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; to cyber-attacks. Last year, Kashmir Hill, senior online editor at Forbes, demonstrated how common security-lapses can allow strangers to gain &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/07/26/smart-homes-hack/#6013508f46a5&#34;&gt;control over ‘smart home’ devices&lt;/a&gt; via internet. Brewster further shows how these vulenerabilities of smart systems may not only come from mistakes while deploying or configuring them, but can simply be caused by &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/message/everything-is-broken-81e5f33a24e1#.ixgu30qhv&#34;&gt;sloppy code&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove the point, a researcher from security consultancy IOActive recently showed that vulnerabilities in road sensors relaying information to traffic lights could be exploited to turn them from red to green, or keep them on a certain colour. The potential impact is all too obvious: traffic carnage and deadly accidents… Many of the weaknesses are basic, [Cesar Cerrudo] says: devices often don’t do adequate validation of the data being sent to them, failing to check whether malicious streams of information are being sent rather than legitimate bits and bytes determining their functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a pattern here: Watch Dogs imagines a smart city that is under control of ‘corrupt officials’ and ‘elite hackers;’ Hill talks about errors commited by uses that expose smart devices; and Brewster reveals how internal shortcomings of smart systems may lead to real-world disasters. In all these narratives, something needs to go wrong — either the people running the smart city, the people deploying the smart systems, or the software running the smart systems — for the smart city to hit a 404 page (or worse). 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/1hpU_Neg1KA&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an imagination of the ‘threat’ of smart cities completely ignores the physical and informational surveillance that will be undertaken as &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; everyday life in a smart city. Data coming out of such surveillance devices will of course be consumed and acted upon by machines and humans alike — as Edward Snowden’s revealations have shown. Further, this entire surveillance will often take place without the residents noticing or giving attention to. Neither the governments nor the corporates, the key controllers of such smart city utilities, have much reputation when it comes to respecting electronic privacy of people, or sensitising the users to seriously consider terms of data usage before using a product/service. The big threat of smart cities does not come from malfunctioning or abuse of those systems, but from their normal usages. These are cities made for watching, and they don’t necessarily come with in-built mechanisms for citizens to watch the watchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With networked infrastructures mixing with physical fabric of the cities (check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ipavement.com/en/&#34;&gt;iPavement&lt;/a&gt;, paving tiles with embedded microcomputer), there is a gradually growing body of urban data. Often this data is not collected or not stored. Often it is stored without being shared. A steady trickling out of this urban data, however, is taking place through open data platforms and various public-private data partnerships. While there emerges a political demand for rights regarding networked objects (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://videos.liftconference.com/video/2902438/adam-greenfield-on-public&#34;&gt;Adam Greenfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/96-DINGPOLITIK-GB.pdf&#34;&gt;Bruno Latour&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.nearfuturelaboratory.com/2006/02/26/a-manifesto-for-networked-objects/&#34;&gt;Near Future Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;), a range of products, services and platforms are coming up that offer to enrich citizenship with accessible and visualised data.

&lt;p&gt;The everyday citizenship in urban areas is increasingly augmented by all kinds of incoming data visuals — &lt;a href=&#34;http://mappinglondon.co.uk/2012/mapped-every-bus-trip-in-london/&#34;&gt;map of ‘every bus trip’&lt;/a&gt; in the city, possibilities of using the same data to pre-empt congestion and resolving them by diversifying traffic, &lt;a href=&#34;http://spatialanalysis.co.uk/2012/04/twitter-languages-london/&#34;&gt;geographic spread of different languages&lt;/a&gt; used to tweet across the city, crime landscape of the cities (and of course you remember &lt;a href=&#34;http://stamen.com/work/crimespotting/&#34;&gt;Crimespotting by Stamen&lt;/a&gt;), catching criminals by real-time data mining, &lt;a href=&#34;http://urbmet.org/&#34;&gt;visualisation of energy and resource intensities&lt;/a&gt; of your city, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hypercities.com/&#34;&gt;exploratory platform&lt;/a&gt; for historical visuals and documents embedded on the city map.

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/pPjKQfGeJv4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a much more extensive scale, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa&#34;&gt;Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, UCL&lt;/a&gt; has developed a &lt;a href=&#34;http://citydashboard.org/london/&#34;&gt;city-wide dashboard&lt;/a&gt; for London that pulls in various environmental, transportation, social and other variables and information. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://livehoods.org/&#34;&gt;Livehoods&lt;/a&gt; portal takes a more social-media intensive approach to create similar city-scale visualisation of human interactions. It employs machine-learning algorithms to &lt;a href=&#34;http://livehoods.org/research&#34;&gt;mine urban conversations&lt;/a&gt; taking place in social networks and create insights about urban living patterns. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbanmobs.fr/en/&#34;&gt;Urban Mobs&lt;/a&gt; takes a similar approach to analyse and visualise ‘crowd communication activities’ using mobile usage data (from Orange). A common problem for such data exploration interfaces is the thickness of information layers — various kinds data about each location makes it difficult to read. &lt;a href=&#34;http://senseable.mit.edu/&#34;&gt;MIT SENSEable City Lab&lt;/a&gt; has developed a visualisation interface called &lt;a href=&#34;http://senseable.mit.edu/visual-explorations-urban-mobility/data-lenses.html&#34;&gt;Data Lenses&lt;/a&gt;. It allows one to separately track variables, to switch between variables to understand patterns, to change zoom levels for various scalar comparison — so as to ease the urban ‘information overload’. 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/P_XBL5hYiqQ&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April, the Open-Data Cities Conference was organised in Brighton, UK, which argued that — “The more data that is released – without strings attached, in machine-readable and non-proprietary &amp;lsquo;open&amp;rsquo; formats – the more likely it is that businesses and developers will use it to build the applications and services that world-class cities need.” The qualities of the ‘world-class cities’ were not clear to begin with and now with informatics thrown in it accumulated further complexity and confusion. Here the idea of ‘open urban data’ is almost like a subsidy — if the government provides no-strings attached data subsidy, then private agencies can use it to produce and address infrastructural needs of digital cities. It remains unanswered how the citizens who have contributed to creation of that data will benefit as governments open up data for commercial use by private agencies (here is a strange case of &lt;a href=&#34;sfappeal.com/news/2009/06/who-owns-sfmta-arrival-data.php&#34;&gt;citizens asked to buy back urban data&lt;/a&gt; created by them). 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//player.vimeo.com/video/42553502&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent series of articles, Urban Times and Design Mind have been exploring this data-driven &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theurbn.com/category/feature/future-of-the-city&#34;&gt;future of cities in the digital age&lt;/a&gt;. The insightful discussion explores the many challenges being faced by engineers, coders, designers, politicians, citizens etc as the ‘smart city’ model of infrastructure provision and management becomes commonplace. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theurbn.com/2012/05/the-future-of-the-city-2-the-networked-urban-environment/&#34;&gt;It notes&lt;/a&gt; that much of the controversy regarding this data-driven approach is entangled with questions of “public and private ownership of space, both in the cloud and on the ground.” 
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Qs4OcQNOM34&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And computer games continue to be right at the cutting edge of spatial speculations. A new game by Ubisoft named ‘&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubisoft.com/de-DE/game/watch-dogs/&#34;&gt;Watch Dogs&lt;/a&gt;‘ is built around a ‘smart city’ operator gone rogue. The centralised urban informatics system is under siege and turned into the weapon against the urban itself. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citylab.com/tech/2012/06/dark-side-smart-city-video-game/2184/&#34;&gt;Nate Berg notes&lt;/a&gt;, the emerging control of spatial systems and built forms by data-driven infrastructure create new possibilities of controlling cities and inflicting networked terror. Of course such systems also create possibilities of counter-vigilance by data-driven citizens. However, data rights of such citizens and data responsibilities of the governments need to be developed and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
